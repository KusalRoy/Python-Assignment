        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Python is a interpreted programming\n",
        "       language. It is very simple to execute & read & understand .\n",
        "       It is popular due to its various libraries, easy access & versatality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -  An interpreter runs code line by line. In Python, it works as a translator so that system can understand command.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Pre defined key words are- if, else, while, for, def.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - No, those can't be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -  Mutability defines if an object can be changed or not, while created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - lists are created to be changed accordingly, like dynamic way. Whereas tuples are fixed and use to store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "     - == checks wheather 2 values are equal or not. Wheather is verifies identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Logical operators in Pyhton are - and, or & not\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Type casting is conversion of one data type into another variable from one type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Implicit type of casting is prformed by Python\n",
        "       only.\n",
        "         whereas\n",
        "\n",
        "       Explicit type of casting is performed by the user itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in   Python?\n",
        "     - Conditional statements are used to run codes based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - elif or else if helps checking multiple conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - We uuse for when we know the number of repetitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "       And while loop is used when we are unaware of the repetitons and the code runs until it false.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "     - where a number of repetitions are unknown such as when we are entering wrong password and it keeps on giving fasle message."
